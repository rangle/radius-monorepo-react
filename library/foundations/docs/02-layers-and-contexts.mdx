# Design Contexts

## What is context in design?

Context is a crucial element in design, as it helps to understand the circumstances, background, or environment in which a person, thing, or idea exists or occurs. This is particularly important when it comes to creating a design system, as it must represent a design language that is tailored to the specific needs of the project or product.

Design decisions are not be made in a vacuum. The designer must always consider the audience and their needs when making design decisions. For example, if the product is intended for older adults, the design should take into account accessibility concerns, such as larger text and high contrast colors.

A design language is a collection of design decisions that are made based on the brand, the use case and the context in which the elements and even the product or project will be used. These decisions can include things like the layout, typography, color scheme, and overall aesthetic of the design. It's important to note that these decisions are not set in stone and can change over time as new contexts are introduced.

## Working with Design Contexts

Design contexts are a way to organize and manage design decisions. They are a way to group design decisions together and to make them easier to find and use. They are also a way to keep track of the design decisions that have been made and to make sure that they are consistent as a design language, and that we know what to do when they are not.
